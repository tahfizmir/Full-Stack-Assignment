# Full Stack Assignment

This repository contains two folders:

- `Client/` — React + Vite frontend
- `Server/` — Express backend

Run both during development from the repository root (requires Node.js and npm):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will run the Express server and the Vite dev server concurrently.

Next steps: implement API endpoints in `Server/` and frontend features in `Client/` for the Event Management System.
